# Color palette recommendation for comfort and purchase intent

## Research limitations
External web sources could not be accessed in this environment (see command log). The recommendations below are based on general, widely cited UX/UI and marketing design principles around perceived trust, comfort, and action focus.

## Recommended palette (balanced trust + warmth)
Use a calm, trustworthy base with gentle warmth in accents to encourage action without causing anxiety.

**Primary (trust/comfort):**
- Soft blue: `#3B82F6`
- Deep navy: `#1E3A8A` (headings, emphasis)

**Secondary (reassuring/positive):**
- Soft green: `#22C55E`
- Muted teal: `#14B8A6`

**Neutrals (calm, breathable UI):**
- Off-white background: `#F8FAFC`
- Light gray surface: `#E2E8F0`
- Charcoal text: `#0F172A`

**Warm CTA accent (encourage buying without alarm):**
- Warm coral/orange: `#F97316`
- Lighter hover: `#FB923C`

## Why this palette works (practical reasoning)
- **Blues** are commonly associated with trust and stability, which can reduce perceived risk during purchase decisions.
- **Greens/teals** suggest safety and positive outcomes, reinforcing comfort and “good choice” feelings.
- **Warm accents** (coral/orange) draw attention to call-to-action buttons without the aggressive urgency of bright red.
- **Soft neutrals** prevent visual fatigue and keep the interface feeling open and safe, which helps browsing comfort.

## Usage guidance
- Keep background neutral (`#F8FAFC`) and reserve the warm accent for CTAs only.
- Use blue for primary navigation, links, and trust signals (badges, guarantee blocks).
- Use green/teal for success states, free shipping cues, or “in stock” labels.
- Ensure contrast ratios meet WCAG AA (especially for body text and buttons).

## Next steps to validate
- A/B test CTA color (coral vs. teal) on product and checkout pages.
- Monitor metrics: add-to-cart rate, checkout completion, and time-on-page.
- Run a quick preference test (5-second test) to see whether users describe the UI as “calm,” “safe,” and “easy to buy.”
