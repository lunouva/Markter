## Recommended palette (fun + bright + professional)
A vibrant, modern base with energetic accents and crisp neutrals to keep the experience lively while preserving trust and readability.

- Vivid blue: `#2563EB`
- Deep indigo: `#1E1B4B` (headings, emphasis)

**Secondary (fresh, upbeat support):**
- Bright teal: `#06B6D4`
- Lively green: `#22C55E`

- Sunny amber: `#F59E0B`

**Neutrals (crisp, modern canvas):**
- Pure white: `#FFFFFF`
- Cool gray background: `#F1F5F9`
- Slate text: `#0F172A`

## Why this palette works (practical reasoning)
- **Vivid blues/indigos** signal professionalism and stability, supporting trust for purchase decisions.
- **Teal/green** add freshness and positivity without looking juvenile.
- **Coral/amber accents** feel energetic and modern, drawing attention to CTAs while remaining friendly.
- **Crisp neutrals** keep layouts breathable and ensure strong contrast for readability.

## Usage guidance
- Use the **primary blue** for navigation, links, and primary brand surfaces.
- Reserve **coral** for primary CTAs and **amber** for secondary highlights (promo badges, limited offers).
- Use **teal/green** for supportive UI states (success, reassurance, “in stock”).
- Keep the background mostly **white/cool gray** to maintain a modern, clean feel.
- Ensure contrast ratios meet WCAG AA, especially for text and button labels.

## Next steps to validate
- A/B test CTA color (coral vs. amber) on product and checkout pages.
- Track add-to-cart rate, checkout completion, and time-on-page.
- Run a quick preference test to confirm users describe the UI as “fun,” “bright,” and “trustworthy.”
