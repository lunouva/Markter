# Sales Call Script (Assumptive + Assurance)
- Opening: "Thanks for the time. I'll ask a few quick questions, then we'll map the first 10 days and lock next steps."
- Discovery: "What's the primary engagement goal right now - calls, forms, map actions, or on-site actions?"
- Assurance framing: "We start with our 10-Day Results Assurance - first month of management is free, you only cover ad spend, no lock-ins during the assurance window. We measure engagement signals, not sales guarantees."
- Budget hesitation: "We can start conservatively. The spend is the test lever, and the assurance keeps it contained."
- Skepticism: "Totally fair. The assurance puts the pressure on us to show engagement quickly."
- Booking close: "Let's lock the kickoff. Do mornings or afternoons work better? We can do Tuesday or Thursday."
- Fail-safe exit: "If timing isn't right, we can pause and pick a date later. I'll send a short recap."
