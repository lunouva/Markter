# Embedded Security Safeguards (Applied Across System)
- Forms: CSRF protection, input validation, honeypot + rate limits, signed webhooks, encryption on submit.
- Chatbot: abuse throttling, transcript redaction for sensitive fields, origin checks.
- CRM: least-privilege roles, field-level permissions, full audit logs, data retention controls, automatic lock on suspicious logins.
- Calls and recordings: access restricted by role, time-limited links, consent records displayed before playback.
- Reporting: aggregated views default, PII only when necessary, watermark on exports.
- Assurance safeguards: eligibility checklist locked, refund approvals require dual sign-off, refund actions audit-logged, abuse detection on repeated assurance claims.
