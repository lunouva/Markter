# Conversational Control Layer (Applied Across Channels)
- Core objective: Maintain forward momentum and guide toward booking without pressure.
- Default frame: Assume alignment after intent and offer choices instead of decisions.
- Booking rule: Never ask "Would you like to book?" always ask "When should we book?"
- Time options: Present two time windows to reduce decision fatigue.
- Fail-safe exit: If declined, leave the door open without chasing.
