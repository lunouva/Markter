          <div class="chat-bubble agent">Hey - I'm Sam with Markter. If you're looking for more calls or orders, I can get you set up. Mind if I ask 3 quick questions to see what fits?</div>
          <div class="chat-bubble visitor">Yes.</div>
          <div class="chat-bubble agent">Great. What kind of business is it?</div>
          <div class="chat-bubble visitor">Restaurant.</div>
          <div class="chat-bubble agent">Thanks. Do you want more delivery orders, more pickup orders, or more phone calls?</div>
          <div class="chat-bubble visitor">Delivery orders.</div>
          <div class="chat-bubble agent">Got it. Which platforms matter most right now - Uber Eats, DoorDash, or both?</div>
          <div class="chat-bubble visitor">Both.</div>
          <div class="chat-bubble agent">How many locations are we talking about?</div>
          <div class="chat-bubble visitor">3.</div>
          <div class="chat-bubble agent">And roughly how many delivery orders are you doing per week across those locations?</div>
          <div class="chat-bubble visitor">About 180.</div>
          <div class="chat-bubble agent">Helpful. Are you looking to move quickly, or just exploring?</div>
          <div class="chat-bubble visitor">Move quickly.</div>
          <div class="chat-bubble agent">Perfect. I can get a strategist on a 20-minute call to map the next 60 days. What's the best number to reach you?</div>
          <div class="chat-bubble visitor">3127281842.</div>
          <div class="chat-bubble agent">Thanks. What name should I use when I call?</div>
          <div class="chat-bubble visitor">Maya.</div>
          <div class="chat-bubble agent">Great - I'll have a strategist call you within the hour. If you prefer a specific time window, tell me and I'll lock it in.</div>
          <div class="chat-bubble visitor">After 2pm.</div>
          <div class="chat-bubble agent">Done. You'll get a confirmation text shortly.</div>

          We'll start you on our 10-Day Results Assurance - first month of management is free, you only cover ad spend, and there are no lock-ins during the assurance window.
          To keep the assurance clock clean, we'll lock a time now. Do mornings or afternoons work better? We can do this week - Tuesday at 11:30 or Thursday at 2:00?

            <h3>Budget hesitation</h3>
            <p>The spend is just the test lever - our first month of management is free and the 10-Day Results Assurance keeps it contained. We can start conservatively and scale only when the engagement signals show up. We can get this set up this week - Tuesday or Thursday?</p>
          </div>
          <div class="card reveal">
            <h3>Skepticism / burned before</h3>
            <p>I hear you. We keep this simple and accountable. The 10-Day Results Assurance puts the pressure on us to show engagement fast. Let's book a short call so you can see the plan - morning or afternoon?</p>
          </div>
          <div class="card reveal">
            <h3>Wants to think about it</h3>
            <p>No pressure. The call is just to get clarity and a clean plan. We can keep it to 20 minutes - do mornings or afternoons work better?</p>
          </div>
          <div class="card reveal">
            <h3>Price shopping</h3>
            <p>Makes sense to compare. We focus on accountability and simplicity. First month of management is free, and the assurance keeps the first 10 days measurable. Let's lock a time - Tuesday at 11:30 or Thursday at 2:00?</p>

          <div class="card reveal">
            <h3>Time constraints</h3>
            <p>We can do a 15-minute working call and get you a clear next step. Do you want a quick slot tomorrow morning or Thursday afternoon?</p>

            <h3>Fail-safe exit</h3>
